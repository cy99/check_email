The Domain Name Service is one of the most important internet services. It is
responsible to translate the domain names into the real internet address.
Without it there was no www.name.com but only numbers like 123.123.123.123.
Imagine you don't have google.com but 74.125.113.99 or 199.59.148.82 instead of
twitter.com or 69.171.229.11 in place of simply facebook.com.
